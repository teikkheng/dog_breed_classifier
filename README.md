# dog_breed_classifier
In this project, we are provided with a training set and a test set of images of dogs. Each image has a filename that is its unique id. The dataset comprises 120 breeds of dogs. The goal is to create a classifier capable of determining a dog's breed from a photo. The dataset is obtained from https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification
